# 🌸 Blossom - Flower Shop Website

**Blossom** is a front-end web project built as part of a university assignment.  
It’s a fully designed flower shop interface featuring shopping, user authentication, and floral arrangements.  
The goal was to design a user-friendly, visually appealing shopping experience — and this project delivers that with soft pastel vibes and elegant layouts.

> ⚠️ Note: This is not a production-ready site. It's a front-end-only concept, built for learning and demonstration purposes.
